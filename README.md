## Race Results 1897-2018 for the Boston Marathon Data Project

This project contains the race results of the Boston Marathon from 1897-2018. To be clear, I have no association with the Boston Athletic Association. If my data contradicts anything provided by the B.A.A. you should assume that I am wrong and they are right. I have accumulated these results from whatever resources I can find and therefore I can't vouch for accuracy or be held responsible for mistakes contained in this data. I make no claims of ownership over this data, I simply share this with the running community as a resource that all of us can learn from. I encourage you to dissect this data and share your findings. My analysis can be found at [https://tread1st.com/boston.html](https://tread1st.com/boston.html) and I welcome feedback.

## Known Discrepencies  
While I am doing everything I can to keep these results accurate, this data is hard to find and verify. Here are some gaps and known errors contained in this data...

**Wheelchair data:** So far I have neglected this data but I plan on adding it as I go.

**2013:** There are 2 csv files for 2013 because there is a second data set that contains runners that were diverted because of the bombing that year. 

**1993 & 1995:** My source for this data had wheelchair data mixed in with the runner results.  I was able to remove all times that were shorter the winner, I assume that there are wheelchair times mixed in with the results.

**1897-1899:** I currently only have the winners of the Boston Marathon for these years.
